# 🔐 PyPassword Generator – 100 Days of Code (Day 5)

This is a simple and interactive **Password Generator** built with Python as part of the #100DaysOfCode challenge (Day 5) using Dr. Angela Yu’s Python Bootcamp.

It allows users to customize the number of letters, numbers, and symbols in the generated password, providing both flexibility and strong security.
